# CREATE A SIMPLE CLUSTER USING EKSCTL

We are going to create an EKS cluster using eksctl, and we need to have an SSH key pair registered on AWS because we will use this key to access the nodes. To create an SSH key pair, you can use the AWS Console (EC2 &gt; Key Pairs) or run the following command:

     aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name BerryKey --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > BerryKey.pem

Remember that the key is completely free on AWS, so you donâ€™t need to delete it after the tutorial. You only need to create it once.

You can try to use eksctl creating a cluster without nodegroups by running the command below

    eksctl create cluster --name=BerryCluster01 --region=eu-west-1 --zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b --without-nodegroup 

Now we need to associate an IAM OIDC provider to our EKS-Cluster , we can do it by running the following command:
    
     eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region eu-west-1 --cluster BerryCluster01 --approve

after that you can now create a nodegroup by yourself, we do it separetly to give more attention to this part of the operation.
Run the following command :

     eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=BerryCluster01 \                    # name of your cluster
                       --region=eu-west-1 \                                # region name
                       --name=BerryCluster01-nodeGroup01 \                 # name of nodegroup 
                       --node-type=t3.medium \                             # type of EC2 instances for the nodegroup 
                       --nodes=2 \                                         # number of node deployed initially 
                       --nodes-min=2 \                                     # minimum number of nodes 
                       --nodes-max=4 \                                     # max number of nodes
                       --node-volume-size=20 \                             # size of the EBS volume (in GB) for each node. 
                       --ssh-access \                                      # allow direct access to each node via SSH.
                       --ssh-public-key=kube-demo \                        # Specifies the public SSH key to use for access. This key must already exist as an EC2 public key in AWS.
                       --managed \                                         # node group will be automatically managed by EKS for updates and maintenance.Not for production!
                       --asg-access \                                      # Grants the node group access to manage Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).
                       --external-dns-access \                             # permissions to integrate the external-dns service, which enables Kubernetes to manage DNS records.
                       --full-ecr-access \                                 # Provides full access to the ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
                       --appmesh-access \                                  # Gives the node group permissions to interact with App Mesh, AWS's microservices management service.
                       --alb-ingress-access                                # Grants access to manage an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Ingress Controller for inbound traffic to applications in the cluster.

you can now check your nodes using k9s,or running the command :   

     kubectl get nodes 

When you need to delete the cluster you can do it by running the command: 
     
     eksctl delete cluster --name BerryCluster01
